# SDR-GB-SAR

Opensource, openhardware implementation of a Software Defined Radio (SDR) Ground Based Synthetic-Aperture RADAR (GB-SAR)

The instrument is a Ground-Based Synthetic-Aperture-RADAR using a commercial, off the shelf WiFi dongle as pseudo-random
spectrum spread radiofrequency source, a Raspberry Pi 4 for data acquisition and antenna position control, and an Ettus
Research B210 SDR dual channel receiver for RADAR data acquisition.

The rail for moving the antenna set is a commercial, off the shelf device from <a href="https://www.iai-robot.co.jp/">IAI (Japan)</a>.
